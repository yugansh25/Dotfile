### Config files

A configuration file, also known as a config file, is a local file that controls the operations of a program, utility or process. Linux configuration files contain the settings and instructions for different systems, utilities, applications and processes. Theyâ€™re frequently plain-text files that contain a variable name (the name of the setting) followed by it's value, commands or instructions. This makes management of the Linux OS both much easier and more difficult.
